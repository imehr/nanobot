## 📦 Install

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This README may describe features that are available first in the latest source code.
> If you want the newest features and experiments, install from source.
> If you want the most stable day-to-day experience, install from PyPI or with `uv`.

**Install from source** (latest features, experimental changes may land here first; recommended for development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot.git
cd nanobot
pip install -e .
```

**Install with [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)** (stable release, fast)

```bash
uv tool install nanobot-ai
```

**Install from PyPI** (stable release)

```bash
pip install nanobot-ai
```

## 🔀 Fork Maintenance

This checkout is maintained as the customized `imehr` fork, not as a writable copy of upstream. For upstream integrations, use `scripts/sync_upstream_to_fork.sh`; `upstream` is fetch-only here and should never be pushed to.
**PyPI / pip**

```bash
pip install -U nanobot-ai
nanobot --version
```

**uv**

```bash
uv tool upgrade nanobot-ai
nanobot --version
```

**Using WhatsApp?** Rebuild the local bridge after upgrading:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.nanobot/bridge
nanobot channels login whatsapp
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

> [!TIP]
> Set your API key in `~/.nanobot/config.json`.
> Get API keys: [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/keys) (Global)
>
> For other LLM providers, please see the [Providers](#providers) section.
>
> For web search capability setup, please see [Web Search](#web-search).

**1. Initialize**

```bash
nanobot onboard
```

Use `nanobot onboard --wizard` if you want the interactive setup wizard.

**2. Configure** (`~/.nanobot/config.json`)

Configure these **two parts** in your config (other options have defaults).

*Set your API key* (e.g. OpenRouter, recommended for global users):
```json
{
  "providers": {
    "openrouter": {
      "apiKey": "sk-or-v1-xxx"
    }
  }
}
```

*Set your model*:
```json
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "model": "anthropic/claude-opus-4-5"
    }
  }
}
```

**3. Chat**

```bash
nanobot agent
```

That's it! You have a working AI assistant in 2 minutes.

## 🧠 Hybrid Knowledge Capture

`nanobot` can now route raw material into a hybrid memory layout instead of relying only on chat history.

Start here for the practical setup and day-to-day workflows:

- [Hybrid Knowledge Capture Guide](docs/hybrid-knowledge-capture.md)

### Storage layout

- `~/.nanobot/workspace/queue/` and related runtime folders — temporary queue state and processing logs
- `Mehr/` — canonical organized memory
- `Mehr/Projects/<project>/` — concise project summaries, decisions, timelines, and feature notes
- `Nanobot Archive/` — preserved originals when evidence is worth keeping outside canonical memory
- `memory/MEMORY.md` — compact always-loaded summary context

### Configure local capture

Add this to `~/.nanobot/config.json`:

```json
{
  "knowledge": {
    "watchedPaths": [
      "~/Drop to Nanobot"
    ],
    "localWeb": {
      "enabled": true,
      "bind": "127.0.0.1",
      "port": 18791
    },
    "nativeCapture": {
      "enabled": true,
      "bind": "127.0.0.1",
      "port": 18792,
      "authToken": "choose-a-long-random-token"
    }
  }
}
```

Start the gateway:

```bash
nanobot gateway
```

### Capture methods

- **Mac CLI wrappers**
  - These are the easiest hooks for Shortcuts and Quick Actions

```bash
nanobot capture text "This is my regular bike service centre" --hint bike
nanobot capture file ~/Downloads/invoice.pdf --hint bike --note "10,000 km service"
nanobot capture clipboard --hint bike
```

- **Watched folder**
  - Drop screenshots, PDFs, receipts, or other files into a watched folder such as `~/Drop to Nanobot`
- **Nanobot Capture for Web**
  - Send notes or upload files from browser tools, Mac shortcuts, or other machines on your LAN

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:18791/capture \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"content_text":"This service invoice is for my bike","user_hint":"bike"}'
```

- **Browser UI**
  - Open `http://127.0.0.1:18791/` for the local `Nanobot Capture` web app
  - The browser version mirrors the desktop composer with:
    - context and hint fields
    - drag-drop attachments
    - multi-file upload
    - pasted clipboard screenshots/images
    - queue-aware status and recent captures

- **Native macOS app**
  - Build the app in `macos/NanobotCapture/`
  - The app gives you:
    - a menu bar capture panel
    - a normal app window for drag-drop and mixed capture
    - a native Share extension that appears in supported macOS apps
  - The app talks to the separate local-native endpoint on `127.0.0.1:18792`

- **Chat channels**
  - Use `/capture ...` in Telegram, WhatsApp, or other chat channels
  - Example: `/capture This invoice is for my bike and the front tire pressure is 35 psi`
  - If you attach files with `/capture`, `nanobot` preserves the uploaded file before routing it

### Project memory

Use `Mehr/Projects/<project>/` for concise cross-project memory, not full engineering detail.

- repo docs stay the technical source of truth
- `Mehr/Projects` stores short summaries that matter across time and contexts
- preserved originals stay in `Nanobot Archive`, not in project memory

For `nanobot`, the live seed example is:

- `Mehr/Projects/nanobot/index.md`
- `Mehr/Projects/nanobot/decisions.md`
- `Mehr/Projects/nanobot/timeline.md`
- `Mehr/Projects/nanobot/features/*.md`

### Routing behavior

For each captured item, `nanobot` will:

- save the original first,
- classify the item into one or more entities,
- extract durable facts into entity profiles,
- append history when the item represents an event,
- add ledger rows when the item is transactional,
- ask follow-up questions only when ambiguity changes storage or financial treatment.

The local `Nanobot Capture` web app supports JSON capture, browser-based file upload, drag-drop, and pasted clipboard screenshots.

### Recommended Mac setup

1. Create a watched folder such as `~/Drop to Nanobot`
2. Enable both `localWeb` and `nativeCapture` in config
3. Keep `nanobot gateway` running
4. Build and run the app in `macos/NanobotCapture/`
5. Use one or more of:
   - a Shortcut that runs `nanobot capture clipboard --hint bike`
   - a Quick Action that runs `nanobot capture file "$1" --hint bike`
   - the native Nanobot menu bar app
   - the native `Nanobot` Share target from Finder, Safari, Preview, and other supported apps
   - drag-and-drop into the watched folder
   - the `Nanobot Capture` web app at `http://127.0.0.1:18791/`

## 💬 Chat Apps

<details>
<summary><b>Telegram</b> (Recommended)</summary>

**1. Create a bot**
- Open Telegram, search `@BotFather`
- Send `/newbot`, follow prompts
- Copy the token

**2. Configure**

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "telegram": {
      "enabled": true,
      "token": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN",
      "allowFrom": ["YOUR_USER_ID"]
    }
  }
}
```

> You can find your **User ID** in Telegram settings. It is shown as `@yourUserId`.
> Copy this value **without the `@` symbol** and paste it into the config file.


**3. Run**

```bash
nanobot gateway
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Mochat (Claw IM)</b></summary>

Uses **Socket.IO WebSocket** by default, with HTTP polling fallback.

**1. Ask nanobot to set up Mochat for you**

Simply send this message to nanobot (replace `xxx@xxx` with your real email):

```
Read https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HKUDS/MoChat/refs/heads/main/skills/nanobot/skill.md and register on MoChat. My Email account is xxx@xxx Bind me as your owner and DM me on MoChat.
```

nanobot will automatically register, configure `~/.nanobot/config.json`, and connect to Mochat.

**2. Restart gateway**

```bash
nanobot gateway
```

That's it — nanobot handles the rest!

<br>

<details>
<summary>Manual configuration (advanced)</summary>

If you prefer to configure manually, add the following to `~/.nanobot/config.json`:

> Keep `claw_token` private. It should only be sent in `X-Claw-Token` header to your Mochat API endpoint.

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "mochat": {
      "enabled": true,
      "base_url": "https://mochat.io",
      "socket_url": "https://mochat.io",
      "socket_path": "/socket.io",
      "claw_token": "claw_xxx",
      "agent_user_id": "6982abcdef",
      "sessions": ["*"],
      "panels": ["*"],
      "reply_delay_mode": "non-mention",
      "reply_delay_ms": 120000
    }
  }
}
```



</details>

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Discord</b></summary>

**1. Create a bot**
- Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications
- Create an application → Bot → Add Bot
- Copy the bot token

**2. Enable intents**
- In the Bot settings, enable **MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT**
- (Optional) Enable **SERVER MEMBERS INTENT** if you plan to use allow lists based on member data

**3. Get your User ID**
- Discord Settings → Advanced → enable **Developer Mode**
- Right-click your avatar → **Copy User ID**

**4. Configure**

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "discord": {
      "enabled": true,
      "token": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN",
      "allowFrom": ["YOUR_USER_ID"]
    }
  }
}
```

> `groupPolicy` controls how the bot responds in group channels:
> - `"mention"` (default) — Only respond when @mentioned
> - `"open"` — Respond to all messages
> DMs always respond when the sender is in `allowFrom`.
> - If you set group policy to open create new threads as private threads and then @ the bot into it. Otherwise the thread itself and the channel in which you spawned it will spawn a bot session.

**5. Invite the bot**
- OAuth2 → URL Generator
- Scopes: `bot`
- Bot Permissions: `Send Messages`, `Read Message History`
- Open the generated invite URL and add the bot to your server

**6. Run**

```bash
nanobot gateway
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>WhatsApp</b></summary>

Requires **Node.js ≥18**.

**1. Link device**

```bash
nanobot channels login whatsapp
# Scan QR with WhatsApp → Settings → Linked Devices
```

**2. Configure**

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "whatsapp": {
      "enabled": true,
      "allowFrom": ["+1234567890"]
    }
  }
}
```

**3. Run** (two terminals)

```bash
# Terminal 1
nanobot channels login whatsapp

# Terminal 2
nanobot gateway
```

> WhatsApp bridge updates are not applied automatically for existing installations.
> After upgrading nanobot, rebuild the local bridge with:
> `rm -rf ~/.nanobot/bridge && nanobot channels login whatsapp`

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Feishu</b></summary>

Uses **WebSocket** long connection — no public IP required.

**1. Create a Feishu bot**
- Visit [Feishu Open Platform](https://open.feishu.cn/app)
- Create a new app → Enable **Bot** capability
- **Permissions**:
  - `im:message` (send messages) and `im:message.p2p_msg:readonly` (receive messages)
  - **Streaming replies** (default in nanobot): add **`cardkit:card:write`** (often labeled **Create and update cards** in the Feishu developer console). Required for CardKit entities and streamed assistant text. Older apps may not have it yet — open **Permission management**, enable the scope, then **publish** a new app version if the console requires it.
  - If you **cannot** add `cardkit:card:write`, set `"streaming": false` under `channels.feishu` (see below). The bot still works; replies use normal interactive cards without token-by-token streaming.
- **Events**: Add `im.message.receive_v1` (receive messages)
  - Select **Long Connection** mode (requires running nanobot first to establish connection)
- Get **App ID** and **App Secret** from "Credentials & Basic Info"
- Publish the app

**2. Configure**

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "feishu": {
      "enabled": true,
      "appId": "cli_xxx",
      "appSecret": "xxx",
      "encryptKey": "",
      "verificationToken": "",
      "allowFrom": ["ou_YOUR_OPEN_ID"],
      "groupPolicy": "mention",
      "streaming": true
    }
  }

```

> `streaming` defaults to `true`. Use `false` if your app does not have **`cardkit:card:write`** (see permissions above).
> `encryptKey` and `verificationToken` are optional for Long Connection mode.
> `allowFrom`: Leave empty to allow all users, or add `["ou_xxx"]` to restrict access.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>QQ (QQ单聊)</b></summary>

Uses **botpy SDK** with WebSocket — no public IP required. Currently supports **private messages only**.

**1. Register & create bot**
- Visit [QQ Open Platform](https://q.qq.com) → Register as a developer (personal or enterprise)
- Create a new bot application
- Go to **开发设置 (Developer Settings)** → copy **AppID** and **AppSecret**

**2. Set up sandbox for testing**
- In the bot management console, find **沙箱配置 (Sandbox Config)**
- Under **在消息列表配置**, click **添加成员** and add your own QQ number
- Once added, scan the bot's QR code with mobile QQ → open the bot profile → tap "发消息" to start chatting

**3. Configure**

> - `allowFrom`: Leave empty for public access, or add user openids to restrict. You can find openids in the nanobot logs when a user messages the bot.
> - For production: submit a review in the bot console and publish. See [QQ Bot Docs](https://bot.q.qq.com/wiki/) for the full publishing flow.

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "qq": {
      "enabled": true,
      "appId": "YOUR_APP_ID",
      "secret": "YOUR_APP_SECRET",
      "allowFrom": []
    }
  }
}
```

**4. Run**

```bash
nanobot gateway
```

Now send a message to the bot from QQ — it should respond!

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>DingTalk (钉钉)</b></summary>

Uses **Stream Mode** — no public IP required.

**1. Create a DingTalk bot**
- Visit [DingTalk Open Platform](https://open-dev.dingtalk.com/)
- Create a new app -> Add **Robot** capability
- **Configuration**:
  - Toggle **Stream Mode** ON
- **Permissions**: Add necessary permissions for sending messages
- Get **AppKey** (Client ID) and **AppSecret** (Client Secret) from "Credentials"
- Publish the app

**2. Configure**

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "dingtalk": {
      "enabled": true,
      "clientId": "YOUR_APP_KEY",
      "clientSecret": "YOUR_APP_SECRET",
      "allowFrom": []
    }
  }
}
```

> `allowFrom`: Leave empty to allow all users, or add `["staffId"]` to restrict access.

**3. Run**

```bash
nanobot gateway
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Slack</b></summary>

Uses **Socket Mode** — no public URL required.

**1. Create a Slack app**
- Go to [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/apps) → **Create New App** → "From scratch"
- Pick a name and select your workspace

**2. Configure the app**
- **Socket Mode**: Toggle ON → Generate an **App-Level Token** with `connections:write` scope → copy it (`xapp-...`)
- **OAuth & Permissions**: Add bot scopes: `chat:write`, `reactions:write`, `app_mentions:read`
- **Event Subscriptions**: Toggle ON → Subscribe to bot events: `message.im`, `message.channels`, `app_mention` → Save Changes
- **App Home**: Scroll to **Show Tabs** → Enable **Messages Tab** → Check **"Allow users to send Slash commands and messages from the messages tab"**
- **Install App**: Click **Install to Workspace** → Authorize → copy the **Bot Token** (`xoxb-...`)

**3. Configure nanobot**

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "slack": {
      "enabled": true,
      "botToken": "xoxb-...",
      "appToken": "xapp-...",
      "groupPolicy": "mention"
    }
  }
}
```

**4. Run**

```bash
nanobot gateway
```

DM the bot directly or @mention it in a channel — it should respond!

> [!TIP]
> - `groupPolicy`: `"mention"` (default — respond only when @mentioned), `"open"` (respond to all channel messages), or `"allowlist"` (restrict to specific channels).
> - DM policy defaults to open. Set `"dm": {"enabled": false}` to disable DMs.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Email</b></summary>

Give nanobot its own email account. It polls **IMAP** for incoming mail and replies via **SMTP** — like a personal email assistant.

**1. Get credentials (Gmail example)**
- Create a dedicated Gmail account for your bot (e.g. `my-nanobot@gmail.com`)
- Enable 2-Step Verification → Create an [App Password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
- Use this app password for both IMAP and SMTP

**2. Configure**

> - `consentGranted` must be `true` to allow mailbox access. This is a safety gate — set `false` to fully disable.
> - `allowFrom`: Leave empty to accept emails from anyone, or restrict to specific senders.
> - `smtpUseTls` and `smtpUseSsl` default to `true` / `false` respectively, which is correct for Gmail (port 587 + STARTTLS). No need to set them explicitly.
> - Set `"autoReplyEnabled": false` if you only want to read/analyze emails without sending automatic replies.

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "email": {
      "enabled": true,
      "consentGranted": true,
      "imapHost": "imap.gmail.com",
      "imapPort": 993,
      "imapUsername": "my-nanobot@gmail.com",
      "imapPassword": "your-app-password",
      "smtpHost": "smtp.gmail.com",
      "smtpPort": 587,
      "smtpUsername": "my-nanobot@gmail.com",
      "smtpPassword": "your-app-password",
      "fromAddress": "my-nanobot@gmail.com",
      "allowFrom": ["your-real-email@gmail.com"]
    }
  }

<details>
<summary><b>OpenAI Codex (OAuth)</b></summary>

Codex uses OAuth instead of API keys. Requires a ChatGPT Plus or Pro account.
No `providers.openaiCodex` block is needed in `config.json`; `nanobot provider login` stores the OAuth session outside config.

**1. Login:**
```bash
nanobot provider login openai-codex
```

**2. Set model** (merge into `~/.nanobot/config.json`):
```json
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "model": "openai-codex/gpt-5.1-codex"
    }
  }
}
```

**3. Chat:**
```bash
nanobot agent -m "Hello!"
```

> Docker users: use `docker run -it` for interactive OAuth login.

</details>


<details>
<summary><b>GitHub Copilot (OAuth)</b></summary>

GitHub Copilot uses OAuth instead of API keys. Requires a [GitHub account with a plan](https://github.com/features/copilot/plans) configured.
No `providers.githubCopilot` block is needed in `config.json`; `nanobot provider login` stores the OAuth session outside config.

**1. Login:**
```bash
nanobot provider login github-copilot
```

**2. Set model** (merge into `~/.nanobot/config.json`):
```json
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "model": "github-copilot/gpt-4.1"
    }
  }
}
```

**3. Chat:**
```bash
nanobot agent -m "Hello!"

# Target a specific workspace/config locally
nanobot agent -c ~/.nanobot-telegram/config.json -m "Hello!"

# One-off workspace override on top of that config
nanobot agent -c ~/.nanobot-telegram/config.json -w /tmp/nanobot-telegram-test -m "Hello!"
```

> Docker users: use `docker run -it` for interactive OAuth login.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Custom Provider (Any OpenAI-compatible API)</b></summary>

Connects directly to any OpenAI-compatible endpoint — LM Studio, llama.cpp, Together AI, Fireworks, Azure OpenAI, or any self-hosted server. Model name is passed as-is.

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "custom": {
      "apiKey": "your-api-key",
      "apiBase": "https://api.your-provider.com/v1"
    }
  },
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "model": "your-model-name"
    }
  }
}
```

> For local servers that don't require a key, set `apiKey` to any non-empty string (e.g. `"no-key"`).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Ollama (local)</b></summary>

Run a local model with Ollama, then add to config:

**1. Start Ollama** (example):
```bash
ollama run llama3.2
```

**2. Add to config** (partial — merge into `~/.nanobot/config.json`):
```json
{
  "providers": {
    "ollama": {
      "apiBase": "http://localhost:11434"
    }
  },
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "provider": "ollama",
      "model": "llama3.2"
    }
  }
}
```

> `provider: "auto"` also works when `providers.ollama.apiBase` is configured, but setting `"provider": "ollama"` is the clearest option.

<details>
<summary><b>OpenVINO Model Server (local / OpenAI-compatible)</b></summary>

Run LLMs locally on Intel GPUs using [OpenVINO Model Server](https://docs.openvino.ai/2026/model-server/ovms_docs_llm_quickstart.html). OVMS exposes an OpenAI-compatible API at `/v3`.

> Requires Docker and an Intel GPU with driver access (`/dev/dri`).

**1. Pull the model** (example):

```bash
mkdir -p ov/models && cd ov

docker run -d \
  --rm \
  --user $(id -u):$(id -g) \
  -v $(pwd)/models:/models \
  openvino/model_server:latest-gpu \
  --pull \
  --model_name openai/gpt-oss-20b \
  --model_repository_path /models \
  --source_model OpenVINO/gpt-oss-20b-int4-ov \
  --task text_generation \
  --tool_parser gptoss \
  --reasoning_parser gptoss \
  --enable_prefix_caching true \
  --target_device GPU
```

> This downloads the model weights. Wait for the container to finish before proceeding.

**2. Start the server** (example):

```bash
docker run -d \
  --rm \
  --name ovms \
  --user $(id -u):$(id -g) \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -v $(pwd)/models:/models \
  --device /dev/dri \
  --group-add=$(stat -c "%g" /dev/dri/render* | head -n 1) \
  openvino/model_server:latest-gpu \
  --rest_port 8000 \
  --model_name openai/gpt-oss-20b \
  --model_repository_path /models \
  --source_model OpenVINO/gpt-oss-20b-int4-ov \
  --task text_generation \
  --tool_parser gptoss \
  --reasoning_parser gptoss \
  --enable_prefix_caching true \
  --target_device GPU
```

**3. Add to config** (partial — merge into `~/.nanobot/config.json`):

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "ovms": {
      "apiBase": "http://localhost:8000/v3"
    }
  },
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "provider": "ovms",
      "model": "openai/gpt-oss-20b"
    }
  }
}
```

> OVMS is a local server — no API key required. Supports tool calling (`--tool_parser gptoss`), reasoning (`--reasoning_parser gptoss`), and streaming.
> See the [official OVMS docs](https://docs.openvino.ai/2026/model-server/ovms_docs_llm_quickstart.html) for more details.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>vLLM (local / OpenAI-compatible)</b></summary>

Run your own model with vLLM or any OpenAI-compatible server, then add to config:

**1. Start the server** (example):
```bash
vllm serve meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct --port 8000
```

**2. Add to config** (partial — merge into `~/.nanobot/config.json`):

*Provider (key can be any non-empty string for local):*
```json
{
  "providers": {
    "vllm": {
      "apiKey": "dummy",
      "apiBase": "http://localhost:8000/v1"
    }
  }
}
```

*Model:*
```json
{

<details>
<summary><b>Adding a New Provider (Developer Guide)</b></summary>

nanobot uses a **Provider Registry** (`nanobot/providers/registry.py`) as the single source of truth.
Adding a new provider only takes **2 steps** — no if-elif chains to touch.

**Step 1.** Add a `ProviderSpec` entry to `PROVIDERS` in `nanobot/providers/registry.py`:

```python
ProviderSpec(
    name="myprovider",                   # config field name
    keywords=("myprovider", "mymodel"),  # model-name keywords for auto-matching
    env_key="MYPROVIDER_API_KEY",        # env var name
    display_name="My Provider",          # shown in `nanobot status`
    default_api_base="https://api.myprovider.com/v1",  # OpenAI-compatible endpoint
)
```

**Step 2.** Add a field to `ProvidersConfig` in `nanobot/config/schema.py`:

```python
class ProvidersConfig(BaseModel):
    ...
    myprovider: ProviderConfig = ProviderConfig()
```

That's it! Environment variables, model routing, config matching, and `nanobot status` display will all work automatically.

**Common `ProviderSpec` options:**

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `default_api_base` | OpenAI-compatible base URL | `"https://api.deepseek.com"` |
| `env_extras` | Additional env vars to set | `(("ZHIPUAI_API_KEY", "{api_key}"),)` |
| `model_overrides` | Per-model parameter overrides | `(("kimi-k2.5", {"temperature": 1.0}),)` |
| `is_gateway` | Can route any model (like OpenRouter) | `True` |
| `detect_by_key_prefix` | Detect gateway by API key prefix | `"sk-or-"` |
| `detect_by_base_keyword` | Detect gateway by API base URL | `"openrouter"` |
| `strip_model_prefix` | Strip provider prefix before sending to gateway | `True` (for AiHubMix) |
| `supports_max_completion_tokens` | Use `max_completion_tokens` instead of `max_tokens`; required for providers that reject both being set simultaneously (e.g. VolcEngine) | `True` |

</details>

### Channel Settings

Global settings that apply to all channels. Configure under the `channels` section in `~/.nanobot/config.json`:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "sendProgress": true,
    "sendToolHints": false,
    "sendMaxRetries": 3,
    "telegram": { ... }
  }
}
```

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `sendProgress` | `true` | Stream agent's text progress to the channel |
| `sendToolHints` | `false` | Stream tool-call hints (e.g. `read_file("…")`) |
| `sendMaxRetries` | `3` | Max delivery attempts per outbound message, including the initial send (0-10 configured, minimum 1 actual attempt) |

#### Retry Behavior

Retry is intentionally simple.

When a channel `send()` raises, nanobot retries at the channel-manager layer. By default, `channels.sendMaxRetries` is `3`, and that count includes the initial send.

- **Attempt 1**: Send immediately
- **Attempt 2**: Retry after `1s`
- **Attempt 3**: Retry after `2s`
- **Higher retry budgets**: Backoff continues as `1s`, `2s`, `4s`, then stays capped at `4s`
- **Transient failures**: Network hiccups and temporary API limits often recover on the next attempt
- **Permanent failures**: Invalid tokens, revoked access, or banned channels will exhaust the retry budget and fail cleanly

> [!NOTE]
> This design is deliberate: channel implementations should raise on delivery failure, and the channel manager owns the shared retry policy.
>
> Some channels may still apply small API-specific retries internally. For example, Telegram separately retries timeout and flood-control errors before surfacing a final failure to the manager.
>
> If a channel is completely unreachable, nanobot cannot notify the user through that same channel. Watch logs for `Failed to send to {channel} after N attempts` to spot persistent delivery failures.

### Browser Automation (`agent-browser`)

nanobot uses [`agent-browser`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser) for browser automation tasks.

This browser path is **native to nanobot** and is **not MCP-based**.

By default, web tools are enabled and web search uses `duckduckgo`, so search works out of the box without an API key.

If you want to disable all built-in web tools entirely, set `tools.web.enable` to `false`. This removes both `web_search` and `web_fetch` from the tool list sent to the LLM.

If you need to allow trusted private ranges such as Tailscale / CGNAT addresses, you can explicitly exempt them from SSRF blocking with `tools.ssrfWhitelist`:

```json
{
  "tools": {
    "ssrfWhitelist": ["100.64.0.0/10"]
  }
}
```

| Provider | Config fields | Env var fallback | Free |
|----------|--------------|------------------|------|
| `brave` | `apiKey` | `BRAVE_API_KEY` | No |
| `tavily` | `apiKey` | `TAVILY_API_KEY` | No |
| `jina` | `apiKey` | `JINA_API_KEY` | Free tier (10M tokens) |
| `searxng` | `baseUrl` | `SEARXNG_BASE_URL` | Yes (self-hosted) |
| `duckduckgo` (default) | — | — | Yes |

**Disable all built-in web tools:**
```json
{
  "tools": {
    "web": {
      "enable": false
    }
  }
}
```

**Brave:**

Add browser settings to your `config.json`:
```json
{
  "tools": {
    "browser": {
      "enabled": true,
      "command": "agent-browser",
      "headless": true,
      "timeout": 60,
      "sessionPrefix": "nanobot"
    }
  }
}
```

Install and prepare `agent-browser`:

```bash
npm install -g agent-browser
agent-browser install
```

`nanobot` derives a stable browser session per conversation so login state can be reused across multi-step tasks. If you need to attach to an already signed-in Chrome instance, set `tools.browser.cdpUrl` to your CDP endpoint.

**Jina** (free tier with 10M tokens):
```json
{
  "tools": {
    "web": {
      "search": {
        "provider": "jina",
        "apiKey": "jina_..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**SearXNG** (self-hosted, no API key needed):
```json
{
  "tools": {
    "web": {
      "search": {
        "provider": "searxng",
        "baseUrl": "https://searx.example"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**DuckDuckGo** (zero config):
```json
{
  "tools": {
    "web": {
      "search": {
        "provider": "duckduckgo"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enable` | boolean | `true` | Enable or disable all built-in web tools (`web_search` + `web_fetch`) |
| `proxy` | string or null | `null` | Proxy for all web requests, for example `http://127.0.0.1:7890` |

#### `tools.web.search`

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `provider` | string | `"duckduckgo"` | Search backend: `brave`, `tavily`, `jina`, `searxng`, `duckduckgo` |
| `apiKey` | string | `""` | API key for Brave or Tavily |
| `baseUrl` | string | `""` | Base URL for SearXNG |
| `maxResults` | integer | `5` | Results per search (1–10) |

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)

> [!TIP]
> The config format is compatible with Claude Desktop / Cursor. You can copy MCP server configs directly from any MCP server's README.

nanobot supports [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) — connect external tool servers and use them as native agent tools.

Use MCP for **non-browser** external tools. Browser automation should go through `agent-browser`.

Add MCP servers to your `config.json`:

```json
{
  "tools": {
    "mcpServers": {
      "filesystem": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/dir"]
      },
      "my-remote-mcp": {
        "url": "https://example.com/mcp/",
        "headers": {
          "Authorization": "Bearer xxxxx"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Two transport modes are supported:

| Mode | Config | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Stdio** | `command` + `args` | Local process via `npx` / `uvx` |
| **HTTP** | `url` + `headers` (optional) | Remote endpoint (`https://mcp.example.com/sse`) |

MCP tools are automatically discovered and registered on startup. The LLM can use them alongside built-in tools — no extra configuration needed.




### Security

> [!TIP]
> For production deployments, set `"restrictToWorkspace": true` in your config to sandbox the agent.

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `tools.restrictToWorkspace` | `false` | When `true`, restricts **all** agent tools (shell, file read/write/edit, list) to the workspace directory. Prevents path traversal and out-of-scope access. |
| `tools.exec.enable` | `true` | When `false`, the shell `exec` tool is not registered at all. Use this to completely disable shell command execution. |
| `tools.exec.pathAppend` | `""` | Extra directories to append to `PATH` when running shell commands (e.g. `/usr/sbin` for `ufw`). |
| `channels.*.allowFrom` | `[]` (deny all) | Whitelist of user IDs. Empty denies all; use `["*"]` to allow everyone. |


### Timezone

Time is context. Context should be precise.

By default, nanobot uses `UTC` for runtime time context. If you want the agent to think in your local time, set `agents.defaults.timezone` to a valid [IANA timezone name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones):

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "timezone": "Asia/Shanghai"
    }
  }
}
```

This affects runtime time strings shown to the model, such as runtime context and heartbeat prompts. It also becomes the default timezone for cron schedules when a cron expression omits `tz`, and for one-shot `at` times when the ISO datetime has no explicit offset.

Common examples: `UTC`, `America/New_York`, `America/Los_Angeles`, `Europe/London`, `Europe/Berlin`, `Asia/Tokyo`, `Asia/Shanghai`, `Asia/Singapore`, `Australia/Sydney`.

## 🧩 Multiple Instances

Run multiple nanobot instances simultaneously with separate configs and runtime data. Use `--config` as the main entrypoint. Optionally pass `--workspace` during `onboard` when you want to initialize or update the saved workspace for a specific instance.

### Quick Start

If you want each instance to have its own dedicated workspace from the start, pass both `--config` and `--workspace` during onboarding.

**Initialize instances:**

```bash
# Create separate instance configs and workspaces
nanobot onboard --config ~/.nanobot-telegram/config.json --workspace ~/.nanobot-telegram/workspace
nanobot onboard --config ~/.nanobot-discord/config.json --workspace ~/.nanobot-discord/workspace
nanobot onboard --config ~/.nanobot-feishu/config.json --workspace ~/.nanobot-feishu/workspace
```

**Configure each instance:**

Edit `~/.nanobot-telegram/config.json`, `~/.nanobot-discord/config.json`, etc. with different channel settings. The workspace you passed during `onboard` is saved into each config as that instance's default workspace.

**Run instances:**

```bash
# Instance A - Telegram bot
nanobot gateway --config ~/.nanobot-telegram/config.json

# Instance B - Discord bot  
nanobot gateway --config ~/.nanobot-discord/config.json

# Instance C - Feishu bot with custom port
nanobot gateway --config ~/.nanobot-feishu/config.json --port 18792
```

### Path Resolution

When using `--config`, nanobot derives its runtime data directory from the config file location. The workspace still comes from `agents.defaults.workspace` unless you override it with `--workspace`.

To open a CLI session against one of these instances locally:

```bash
nanobot agent -c ~/.nanobot-telegram/config.json -m "Hello from Telegram instance"
nanobot agent -c ~/.nanobot-discord/config.json -m "Hello from Discord instance"

# Optional one-off workspace override
nanobot agent -c ~/.nanobot-telegram/config.json -w /tmp/nanobot-telegram-test
```

> `nanobot agent` starts a local CLI agent using the selected workspace/config. It does not attach to or proxy through an already running `nanobot gateway` process.

| Component | Resolved From | Example |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| **Config** | `--config` path | `~/.nanobot-A/config.json` |
| **Workspace** | `--workspace` or config | `~/.nanobot-A/workspace/` |
| **Cron Jobs** | config directory | `~/.nanobot-A/cron/` |
| **Media / runtime state** | config directory | `~/.nanobot-A/media/` |

### How It Works

- `--config` selects which config file to load
- By default, the workspace comes from `agents.defaults.workspace` in that config
- If you pass `--workspace`, it overrides the workspace from the config file

### Minimal Setup

1. Copy your base config into a new instance directory.
2. Set a different `agents.defaults.workspace` for that instance.
3. Start the instance with `--config`.

Example config:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "workspace": "~/.nanobot-telegram/workspace",
      "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6"
    }
  },
  "channels": {
    "telegram": {
      "enabled": true,
      "token": "YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN"
    }
  },
  "gateway": {
    "port": 18790
  }
}
```

Start separate instances:

```bash
nanobot gateway --config ~/.nanobot-telegram/config.json
nanobot gateway --config ~/.nanobot-discord/config.json
```

Override workspace for one-off runs when needed:

```bash
nanobot gateway --config ~/.nanobot-telegram/config.json --workspace /tmp/nanobot-telegram-test
```

### Common Use Cases

- Run separate bots for Telegram, Discord, Feishu, and other platforms
- Keep testing and production instances isolated
- Use different models or providers for different teams
- Serve multiple tenants with separate configs and runtime data

### Notes

- Each instance must use a different port if they run at the same time
- Use a different workspace per instance if you want isolated memory, sessions, and skills
- `--workspace` overrides the workspace defined in the config file
- Cron jobs and runtime media/state are derived from the config directory

## 🧠 Memory

nanobot uses a layered memory system designed to stay light in the moment and durable over
time.

- `memory/history.jsonl` stores append-only summarized history
- `SOUL.md`, `USER.md`, and `memory/MEMORY.md` store long-term knowledge managed by Dream
- `Dream` runs on a schedule and can also be triggered manually
- memory changes can be inspected and restored with built-in commands

If you want the full design, see [docs/MEMORY.md](docs/MEMORY.md).

</details>

## 🐍 Python SDK

Use nanobot as a library — no CLI, no gateway, just Python:

```python
from nanobot import Nanobot

bot = Nanobot.from_config()
result = await bot.run("Summarize the README")
print(result.content)
```

Each call carries a `session_key` for conversation isolation — different keys get independent history:

```python
await bot.run("hi", session_key="user-alice")
await bot.run("hi", session_key="task-42")
```

Add lifecycle hooks to observe or customize the agent:

```python
from nanobot.agent import AgentHook, AgentHookContext

class AuditHook(AgentHook):
    async def before_execute_tools(self, ctx: AgentHookContext) -> None:
        for tc in ctx.tool_calls:
            print(f"[tool] {tc.name}")

result = await bot.run("Hello", hooks=[AuditHook()])
```

See [docs/PYTHON_SDK.md](docs/PYTHON_SDK.md) for the full SDK reference.

## 🔌 OpenAI-Compatible API

nanobot can expose a minimal OpenAI-compatible endpoint for local integrations:

```bash
pip install "nanobot-ai[api]"
nanobot serve
```

By default, the API binds to `127.0.0.1:8900`. You can change this in `config.json`.

### Behavior

- Session isolation: pass `"session_id"` in the request body to isolate conversations; omit for a shared default session (`api:default`)
- Single-message input: each request must contain exactly one `user` message
- Fixed model: omit `model`, or pass the same model shown by `/v1/models`
- No streaming: `stream=true` is not supported

### Endpoints

- `GET /health`
- `GET /v1/models`
- `POST /v1/chat/completions`

### curl

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8900/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "hi"}],
    "session_id": "my-session"
  }'
```

### Python (`requests`)

```python
import requests

resp = requests.post(
    "http://127.0.0.1:8900/v1/chat/completions",
    json={
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "hi"}],
        "session_id": "my-session",  # optional: isolate conversation
    },
    timeout=120,
)
resp.raise_for_status()
print(resp.json()["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])
```

### Python (`openai`)

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://127.0.0.1:8900/v1",
    api_key="dummy",
)

resp = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="MiniMax-M2.7",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "hi"}],
    extra_body={"session_id": "my-session"},  # optional: isolate conversation
)
print(resp.choices[0].message.content)
```

## 🐳 Docker

> [!TIP]
> The `-v ~/.nanobot:/root/.nanobot` flag mounts your local config directory into the container, so your config and workspace persist across container restarts.

### Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose run --rm nanobot-cli onboard   # first-time setup
vim ~/.nanobot/config.json                     # add API keys
docker compose up -d nanobot-gateway           # start gateway
```

```bash
docker compose run --rm nanobot-cli agent -m "Hello!"   # run CLI
docker compose logs -f nanobot-gateway                   # view logs
docker compose down                                      # stop
```

### Docker

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t nanobot .

# Initialize config (first time only)
docker run -v ~/.nanobot:/root/.nanobot --rm nanobot onboard

# Edit config on host to add API keys
vim ~/.nanobot/config.json

# Run gateway (connects to enabled channels, e.g. Telegram/Discord/Mochat)
docker run -v ~/.nanobot:/root/.nanobot -p 18790:18790 nanobot gateway

# Or run a single command
docker run -v ~/.nanobot:/root/.nanobot --rm nanobot agent -m "Hello!"
docker run -v ~/.nanobot:/root/.nanobot --rm nanobot status
```
